1. Hacker News spider

	Build a Spider that authenticates into news.ycombinator.com and then extracts your own username and amount of points from the news page top (fake user/pass: scrape1123/scrape1123).



2. Quotes filtering crawler

	Build a spider that scrapes all the quotes from every author listed in quotes.toscrape.com/search.aspx.
