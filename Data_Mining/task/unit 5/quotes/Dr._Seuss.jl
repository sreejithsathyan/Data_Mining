I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living.
Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You.
The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.
I have heard there are troubles of more than one kind. Some come from ahead and some come from behind. But I've bought a big bat. I'm all ready you see. Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me!
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try!
A person's a person, no matter how small.
