There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature.
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.
